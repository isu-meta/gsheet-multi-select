Instructions for using multi-select script

Open a Google Sheet that has the multi-select script running (you will see the Scripts menu at top). Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell you want to populate with multiple values. The column must have a data validation rule set up for this to work.
2. From the Scripts menu, choose Multi-select for this cell...
3. In the sidebar that opens at right, select multiple values to include in the cell.
4. At the top of the sidebar, click Set.
5. Review the cell you populated. The terms should be separated by semicolons.

Note about order: To put values in a certain order, select one value at a time, click Update, deselect the previous value, select the next value, click Update, and so on.

Note about the sidebar:
You can leave the selection sidebar open. When you select any cell that has validation, click Refresh Validation in the script sidebar to bring up that cell's checklist.

Note about apostrophes:
Apostrophes cause a string to split when the script pulls it into an array of values. To avoid this problem, replace apostrophes with the HTML entity &#39;

Example: Artists' studios --> Artists&#39; studios

The apostrophe should appear correctly in the cell and when exported from Google Sheets or OpenRefine.
